# Security Policy

Eyo Peeps,

GitHub asked me to set up a security policy so that in case you guys see a problem you can report it and also which minecraft versions are supported.
So, Here it is!

## Supported Minecraft Versions

These minecraft versions are currently supported on The Hangout minecraft server

| Version | Supported?         |
